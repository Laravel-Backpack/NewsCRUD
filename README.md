## Requirements

This package requires both `backpack/crud` but also `backpack/pro` (the paid addon). If you do NOT have access to `backpack/pro` you can [purchase it here](https://backpackforlaravel.com/pricing). Alternatively, you can use the installation method (A), then:
- remove all PRO features;
- replace PRO fields with FREE fields;


## Installation

Since NewsCRUD is just a Backpack\CRUD example, you can choose to install it one of two ways.

**(A) Download and place files in your application** (recommended; remember to also ```composer require cviebrock/eloquent-sluggable```)

or

**(B) As a package**

The only PRO of installing it as a package is that you may benefit from updates. But the reality is there is very little (if any) bug fixing to do, so you probably won't need to update it, ever.



#### Installation type (A) - download


1) [Download the latest build](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/NewsCRUD/archive/master.zip).

2) Paste the 'app' and 'database' folders over your projects (merge them). No file overwrite warnings should come up.

3) Replace all mentions of 'Backpack\NewsCRUD\app' in the pasted files with your application's namespace ('App' if you haven't changed it):
- app/Http/Controllers/Admin/ArticleCrudController.php
- app/Http/Controllers/Admin/CategoryCrudController.php
- app/Http/Controllers/Admin/TagCrudController.php
- app/Http/Requests/ArticleRequest.php
- app/Http/Requests/CategoryRequest.php
- app/Http/Requests/TagRequest.php
- app/Models/Article.php
- app/Models/Category.php
- app/Models/Tag.php

4) Run the migration to have the database table we need:
```
php artisan migrate
```

5) Add NewsCRUD to your routes file:

```
Route::group(['prefix' => config('backpack.base.route_prefix', 'admin'), 'middleware' => ['web', 'auth'], 'namespace' => 'Admin'], function () {
    // Backpack\NewsCRUD
    Route::crud('article', 'ArticleCrudController');
    Route::crud('category', 'CategoryCrudController');
    Route::crud('tag', 'TagCrudController');
});
```

6) [optional] Add a menu item for it in resources/views/vendor/backpack/ui/inc/menu_items.blade.php:

```html
<x-backpack::menu-dropdown title="Add-ons" icon="la la-puzzle-piece">
    <x-backpack::menu-dropdown-header title="News" />
    <x-backpack::menu-dropdown-item title="Articles" icon="la la-newspaper-o" :link="backpack_url('article')" />
    <x-backpack::menu-dropdown-item title="Categories" icon="la la-list" :link="backpack_url('category')" />
    <x-backpack::menu-dropdown-item title="Tags" icon="la la-tag" :link="backpack_url('tag')" />
</x-backpack::menu-dropdown>
```

7) [optional] If you need the browse field to upload images, please install [Laravel-Backpack/FileManager](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/FileManager#installation).


#### Installation type (B) - package

1) In your terminal, run:

``` bash
composer require backpack/newscrud
```

2) Publish the migration:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Backpack\NewsCRUD\NewsCRUDServiceProvider"
```

3) Run the migration to have the database table we need:

```
php artisan migrate
```

4) [optional] Add a menu item for it in resources/views/vendor/backpack/ui/inc/menu_items.blade.php:

```html
<x-backpack::menu-dropdown title="Add-ons" icon="la la-puzzle-piece">
    <x-backpack::menu-dropdown-header title="News" />
    <x-backpack::menu-dropdown-item title="Articles" icon="la la-newspaper-o" :link="backpack_url('article')" />
    <x-backpack::menu-dropdown-item title="Categories" icon="la la-list" :link="backpack_url('category')" />
    <x-backpack::menu-dropdown-item title="Tags" icon="la la-tag" :link="backpack_url('tag')" />
</x-backpack::menu-dropdown>
```

5) [optional] If you need the browse field to upload images, please install [Laravel-Backpack/FileManager](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/FileManager#installation).



## Change log

Please see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more information what has changed recently.

## Testing

``` bash
$ composer test
```

## Overwriting functionality

If you need to modify how this works in a project:
- create a ```routes/backpack/newscrud.php``` file; the package will see that, and load _your_ routes file, instead of the one in the package;
- create controllers/models that extend the ones in the package, and use those in your new routes file;
- modify anything you'd like in the new controllers/models;
